        <h1><center>Mechanism of ascent of sap</center> </h1>
        The ascent of sap, or the upward movement of water and dissolved nutrients in plants, is primarily driven
         by transpiration and the cohesive and adhesive properties of water. This process involves a continuous column
        of water moving from the roots to the leaves, utilizing the xylem vessels and the properties of water. 
        Elaboration:
Transpiration:
       The process of water evaporation from leaves creates a negative pressure, or "tension," within the xylem 
       vessels. This tension acts like a "pull" that draws water upwards from the roots. 
       Cohesion and Adhesion:
       Water molecules are attracted to each other (cohesion) and to the polar surfaces of the xylem cell
        walls (adhesion). These forces contribute to the continuous water column, preventing it from breaking
         as it rises. 
Xylem Vessels:
      The xylem, a vascular tissue, acts as a conduit for the upward movement of water. The dead cells within
       the xylem, known as vessels or tracheids, form a continuous pathway for water to travel. 
Root Pressure:
      In addition to transpiration, root pressure can also contribute to the upward movement of water,
       especially when transpiration rates are low. Root pressure is a positive pressure generated in the
        xylem of the root that pushes water upwards
